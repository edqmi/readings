# Readings and Examples for Teaching

The purpose of this repository is to house readings and examples for teaching different methods in education research. Examples shared here should be positive examples of papers that help students clearly understand how to think about and use quantitative methods. Examples can also include associated teaching materials. There are several principles that we will try to uphold in this repository.

1. __Papers should be *good* examples__: While there is certainly value to presenting examples of research for students to critique, this respository will be focused specifically on examples for teaching that show students *positive* examples of writing and analysis. 
2. __Papers should be clear__: The purpose of these papers is to teach, so including papers for which learners who are *first* learning the method would be able to clearly understand what is happening (e.g., detailed data collection, explicit checking of assumptions, explanations of robustness checks) should be included.
